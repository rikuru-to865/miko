"In miko, the part of a template enclosed in a two-lettered hat caret is a"
" function and is executed in Python.   This enclosed area is called a "
"block in miko.   The block is replaced by the value returned by the "
"block.   In addition, the last line of the block is automatically "
"replaced by `return` even if you don't write `return`.   If you don't "
"know, it is faster to look at an example."
